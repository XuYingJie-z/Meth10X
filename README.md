# WGBSX10

## This is a pipeline of parallel alignment whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) or nucleosome occupancy and DNA methylation (NOMEseq) from fastq files of multi samples (approx. 8-16 samples with more than 20X coverage for each) and generating a tsv big table of CG/CHH/CHG, SNP calling, bigwig of whole genome coverage, only CpG coverage, CpG methylation, quality control metrics of these samples

## WGBSX10 is built based on Bpipe and a collection of software packages:
### bwa-meth
### bedtools
### MethylDackel
### Biscuit
### MethylSeekR
### trimCEGX
### makeFullDataFrame
